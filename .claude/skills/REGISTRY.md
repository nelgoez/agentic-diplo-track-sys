This file is the per-session compact-rules cache for the Skill Resolver protocol.
The orchestrator copies one or more `## Skill: <slug>` blocks below into every subagent briefing under `## Project Standards (auto-resolved)`.
Subagents trust those compact rules and only read the full SKILL.md when explicitly instructed.

## Skill: acli

**Purpose**: Atlassian CLI (official `acli` binary, v1.3+ as of 2026) for Jira Cloud, Confluence Cloud, and org admin tasks from the terminal.

**Compact Rules**:
- **Silent pagination truncation.** `workitem search` without `--paginate` returns the first page only — no warning. Scripts that count or iterate keys read the wrong number of items.
- **Auth is per-product.** `acli jira auth login` does not authenticate `acli admin`, `acli confluence`, or `acli rovodev`. There is also a top-level `acli auth` for global OAuth (newer surface). Each scope has its own session.
- **The "work item" vs "issue" split.** The CLI renamed commands (`jira issue` → `jira workitem`) but the JSON response still has a top-level `issues[]` array and CSV inputs still use `issueType`/`parentIssueId` spellings. Mixing old and new terminology in the same script works, but confuses readers.
- **Unknown subcommands fail silently.** Typing `acli jira workflow --help` does NOT error — it falls back to `acli jira --help` with exit 0. So "no error" ≠ "command exists". Always verify by checking the help body actually changed.
- **Hard limits the docs do not advertise.** `acli` cannot list custom fields, edit custom-field values on existing items, manage workflows, manage issue types, or touch project versions/components. See `references/gotchas.md`.
- Read `complementary_categories` from this skill's frontmatter (`issue-tracker`).
- Resolve via the host repo's skill-registry cache (`.claude/skills/REGISTRY.md`, built by `scripts/build-skill-registry.ts`). Fallback: scan the session-start `system-reminder` skill list.
- Apply the threshold rule per the host repo's skill-composition strategy doc (T1 / T3 silent; T4 ASK).
- The Atlassian MCP fallback documented below is OPT-IN, not a skill — enable manually via `docs/mcp/`.
- `acli` binary is not installed in the environment.
- `acli` auth fails and cannot be fixed in the current session.
- The operation is one of the documented `acli` blind spots: enumerate custom fields, edit custom-field values on existing work items, manage workflows / issue types / priorities / resolutions / project versions / components, upload attachments, add watchers, add an item to a sprint.
- Bulk operations (acli consumes far fewer tokens per call).
- Scripting / CI pipelines.
- Operations that return large result sets (MCP payloads inflate token usage).

- `exploratory-testing` orchestrates the manual validation of features deployed to staging: smoke tests to confirm deployment health, deep exploratory sessions using the Trifuerza methodology (UI + API + DB), structured bug reporting, and session summary reports.
- This skill runs **after** shift-left test planning (`.prompts/fase-5-shift-left-testing/`) and **before** formal test documentation (`.prompts/fase-11-test-documentation/`) and automation (`.prompts/fase-12-test-automation/`).

## Skill: git-flow-master

**Purpose**: End-to-end Git operator for any branching strategy.

**Compact Rules**:
- "I want to start work on UPEX-123" → branch creation
- "commit and push", "subir cambios", "push to main" → commit + push flow
- "abrí un PR contra staging" → PR creation
- "tengo conflictos al hacer pull" → conflict resolution
- "este PR va a quedar enorme" → chained-PR planning hand-off
- "qué estrategia de git usamos en este repo" → strategy detection / persistence
- "el push fue rechazado" → diagnostic + recovery flow
- Current branch.
- Dirty / clean working tree (staged / unstaged / untracked counts).
- Unpushed / unpulled commits (ahead / behind upstream).
- Upstream status (no upstream, up-to-date, diverged).
- Remote name(s) — most repos have one (`origin`); some have a fork + upstream.
- **Marker in `CLAUDE.md`** — search for `<!-- git-flow-master:strategy:VALUE -->` where `VALUE` is one of the seven slugs. If found, use it. This is the persisted decision. Also read the decision markers if present — `<!-- git-flow-master:integration-branch:NAME -->`, `<!-- git-flow-master:promote-method:... -->`, `<!-- git-flow-master:feature-merge:... -->`, `<!-- git-flow-master:hotfix-policy:... -->`. Each marker that resolves a questionnaire answer means Strategy Setup SKIPS that question on re-run (idempotent).
- **Single-branch heuristic** — `git branch -a` shows only `main` (or `master`) and no integration branch in the remote → `solo-main`.
- **Two-branch heuristic** — exactly `main` (or `master`) + one of `{staging, dev, develop, integration}` exists upstream → `main-integration` (record the integration branch name).

## Skill: product-management

**Purpose**: Orchestrates continuous product management work — initial backlog seed from PRD, incremental feature addition, epic creation, story refin...

**Compact Rules**:
- A new feature or epic needs to be added to the backlog
- A story has rough or ambiguous acceptance criteria that need sharpening
- A story needs INVEST validation or a 3-amigos session before development starts
- You're systematically enumerating edge cases / failure modes for a feature
- You're seeding the very first product backlog from a freshly minted PRD
- `/project-foundation` should have produced `.context/PRD/` and `.context/SRS/` (required for the initial backlog-seed workflow; useful context for all others)
- `.agents/project.yaml` populated with `{{PROJECT_KEY}}`, `{{ISSUE_TRACKER}}`, `{{ATLASSIAN_URL}}` — these ship with the cloned boilerplate; if missing, clone the full repo
- Atlassian / Jira tooling reachable (Atlassian CLI `acli` preferred, MCP Atlassian as fallback) for any workflow that writes to Jira
- `.agents/project.yaml` — project identity, env URLs, project key, MCP names.
- `.agents/jira-required.yaml` — canonical slug catalog (fields + statuses + link types).
- `.agents/jira-fields.json` — slug → numeric custom-field-ID mapping.
- `.agents/jira-workflows.json` — workflow + transition catalog.
- `.agents/jira-link-types.json` — slug → workspace link-type mapping (when present).
- `.context/master-implementation-plan.md` — Master Sprint roadmap.

## Skill: project-board-review

**Purpose**: (no description in frontmatter)

**Compact Rules**:
- `project-board-review` launches subagents in key roles (Product Owner, Engineering Manager, QA Lead) to assess a project from multiple perspectives and produce a consolidated board review report for the VP/CEO/company owner.
- Each subagent analyzes their domain, flags risks, and provides recommendations. The report is delivered in a format ready for stakeholder review.
- ---
- Trigger on: `project board review`, `stakeholder review`, `project assessment`, `PO + EM review`, `board report`, `CEO review`
- ---
- ---
- Launch all three subagents in **parallel**. Each subagent must:
- 1. Read relevant project files (`master-implementation-plan.md`, `business-data-map.md`, `project-dev-guide.md`, `project.yaml`)
- 2. Inspect the live API at `{{environments.staging.api_url}}` (health, docs, key endpoints)
- 3. Analyze from their role's perspective
- 4. Flag **critical risks** that need immediate VP/CEO attention
- 5. Provide a clean report with: findings, risks (🔴/🟡/🟢), recommendations
- Each subagent MUST end their report with:
- This gates the report — the VP must acknowledge or redirect before proceeding.
- The orchestrator (this skill) reads all three reports and produces a consolidated board review covering:

## Skill: shift-left-testing

**Purpose**: Orchestrates pre-sprint Shift-Left QA on a batch of backlog Stories.

**Compact Rules**:
- ACs are the FLOOR. Refinement's job is to push past the happy-path contract: surface the boundaries, exceptions, states, and anomalies the Story is silent on.
- 1:N is the default: a non-trivial AC implies multiple outlines (valid partition + each distinct invalid + boundaries + states). A 1-outline AC requires a written "trivially atomic" justification — never the default.
- Tag each refinement gap to a technique: ranges/limits → BVA; status/lifecycle fields → State-Transition; 2+ interacting conditions → Decision Table; 3+ combinable factors → Pairwise.
- A refined AC (Given/When/Then) is the business assertion; the outline (`Should <behavior> <condition>`) is its exploration. Keep them distinct.
- Stories ONLY (no bugs — nothing to refine upstream). Entry status Backlog / Shift-Left QA / Estimation / Ready For Dev.
- Output = refined ACs + gap/ambiguity questions + ATP DRAFT (outline NAMES + coverage estimate, no test code, no execution).
- The heart of the skill (Phase 2) = edge cases not in story + ambiguities + gaps — feed them to PO/Dev as questions AND as derived outlines.
- On completion: add label `shift-left-reviewed`; transition Backlog → Shift-Left QA → Estimation.

## Skill: sprint-development

**Purpose**: Orchestrates the per-story dev loop end-to-end: Planning -> Implementation -> Code Review -> Staging deploy -> (gated) Production deploy.

**Compact Rules**:
- **New user story** (most common) -> Stage 1 (story-plan) -> Stage 2 (implement-story) -> ... -> Stage 4
- **New feature with multiple stories** -> Stage 1 macro (feature-plan) -> loop Stage 1+2 per story -> Stage 4 per merge
- **Bug fix** -> skip to Stage 2 with `bug-fix-workflow.md` (root cause first), then Stage 3+4
- **Resume from interruption** -> Stage 2 entry via `continue-implementation.md`
- **PR feedback / code review iteration** -> Stage 3 with `fix-issues.md`, fix-and-iterate loop
- **Production deploy** (separate event) -> Stage 5, only after QA green + business approval
- `.agents/project.yaml` populated. If missing, clone the full boilerplate — foundation files ship with the repo.
- Story exists in the issue tracker with refined Acceptance Criteria. If backlog is empty or AC are unclear, run `/product-management` first.
- Branch policy clear and CI configured. First-time-only setup lives in `references/setup-linting.md` and `references/ci-cd-setup.md`.
- Working directory is the **target project repo**. Sprint-dev runs there, not in the boilerplate.
- `.env` populated with environment URLs and credentials. Never hardcode credentials.
- `.agents/project.yaml` — project identity, env URLs, project key, MCP names.
- `.agents/jira-required.yaml` — canonical slug catalog (custom fields, statuses, link types) for the active workspace.
- `.agents/jira-fields.json` — slug → numeric custom-field-ID mapping for `{{jira.<slug>}}` resolution.
- `.agents/jira-workflows.json` — workflow + transition catalog (resolves Ready For Dev → In Progress → In Review → Ready For QA).

## Skill: sprint-gate-review

**Purpose**: (no description in frontmatter)

**Compact Rules**:
- `sprint-gate-review` audits PBI documentation completeness before progressing to the next development phase. It acts as a phase gate, verifying that all stories have spec.md, impl-plan.md, edge-cases.md, and compliance-matrix.md artifacts before allowing the team to begin implementation.
- ---
- Trigger on: `sprint gate`, `phase gate review`, `backlog audit`, `PBI readiness check`, `story audit`, `ready for sprint`, `backlog health check`
- Do NOT use for: implementation, testing, product definition, or infrastructure scaffolding.
- ---
- For each story in scope, verify:
- **Scoring**: Each gate = pass/fail. Pass = 1, Fail = 0. All 3 passes = Ready. Any fail = remediation task.
- ---
- Read `master-implementation-plan.md` to identify upcoming phase stories.
- For each story folder in `.context/PBI/{STORY-KEY}/`, verify all 4 files exist.
- For each artifact present, evaluate clarity and compliance.
- Output a readiness matrix:
- Flag failing stories. Assign remediation owner. Block phase progression until all stories pass.

## Skill: sprint-testing

**Purpose**: Orchestrates in-sprint manual QA per ticket across Stages 1 (Planning), 2 (Execution) and 3 (Reporting).

**Compact Rules**:
- AC-pass is the FLOOR, not the goal. Coverage = AC-conformance + risk-beyond-AC (boundaries, errors, states, anomalies). Never report "% of ACs verified" as completeness.
- 1:N is the default: explode every non-trivial AC into multiple cases (EP partitions + boundaries + states + contexts). Collapsing an AC to one case requires a written "trivially atomic" justification.
- Apply techniques by trigger: EP always; BVA wherever a range / limit / length / date-window exists; State-Transition for stateful entities; Decision Table when 2+ conditions interact; Pairwise when 3+ combinable factors (log the reduction); Error-Guessing charters for experience-based risk.
- A criterion is a business assertion; a test case is a concrete exploration of it. Run the Test-Design Checklist before finalizing the ATP.
- Three stages, always in order: Stage 1 Planning → Stage 2 Execution → Stage 3 Reporting. Hand off Stages 4/5/6 to `test-documentation` / `test-automation` / `regression-testing`.
- Jira is source of truth. Read tickets via `bun run jira:sync-issues get <KEY> --include-comments`, then the synced `.md`. NEVER `acli workitem view` for custom fields (returns `null`).
- Bugs run the veto + triage + risk-score decision tree BEFORE any ATP is written.
- Execution = smoke pass first, then trifuerza (UI/API/DB) exploration; capture evidence under the PBI folder.
- Consult `domain-glossary.md` (if present) before authoring the ATP, refined ACs, and TC outlines.
- On any subagent failure: STOP, report partial state, offer retry / skip-stage / abort. No auto-fix, no auto-rollback.

## Skill: testability-guide

**Purpose**: Generates a public in-app `/qa` page ("Software Testability Guide for QA") + a tool-agnostic credentials artifact (markdown body) the use...

**Compact Rules**:
- **A public `/qa` page inside the app** titled _"Software Testability Guide for QA"_ — explains the architecture, demo users, DB-level testing via DBHub MCP, API-level testing via OpenAPI MCP, UI-level testing via Playwright (scripted and agentic). The page links out to the real credentials but never inlines them.
- **A tool-agnostic credentials artifact** (a markdown body) that holds the real DB connection, API login, demo passwords, OpenAPI spec URL, and Swagger UI link. The user picks where this artifact gets published: a Jira Epic (default), a Confluence page, a Notion page, any tool reachable via an MCP or a CLI, or — as a last resort — manual paste.
- `.agents/project.yaml` — project identity, env URLs, default branch, MCP names.
- `.mcp.json` — available MCP servers (Atlassian, Notion, etc.). Determines which publisher targets are reachable.
- `app/qa/page.tsx` snapshot (or framework-equivalent location) when present — current state of the `/qa` page; needed for the idempotency / drift-detection check (Phase 2).
- The publisher target's API contract — varies by Q1 answer: Jira Epic via `[ISSUE_TRACKER_TOOL]`, Confluence page via `[KNOWLEDGE_BASE_TOOL]`, Notion page via Notion MCP, generic MCP / CLI per `references/publishers/`.
- `.env.example` — to know which credentials slots the credentials artifact should reference by name (NEVER quote the actual values).
- `agentic-dev-core/references/briefing-template.md` — used when dispatching parallel sub-agents (e.g. page codegen + credentials-artifact publish in parallel).
- `agentic-dev-core/references/dispatch-patterns.md` — picks Single / Sequential / Parallel for each phase.
- `agentic-dev-core/references/skill-composition-strategy.md` — composition contract consumed by the auto-resolve step below.
- `agentic-dev-core/references/orchestration-doctrine.md` — mandatory subagent dispatch (main thread is command center).
- `agentic-dev-core/references/session-management.md` — Phase 0 resume contract, plan-first persistence at `.session/testability-guide/`, archive on completion.
- Read `complementary_categories` from this skill's frontmatter.
- Resolve via local skill-registry script (`scripts/build-skill-registry.ts` → cached at `.claude/skills/REGISTRY.md`). Fallback: scan the session-start `system-reminder` skill list.
- Classify tier per strategy doc §2.

## Skill: vercel-cli

**Purpose**: (no description in frontmatter)

**Compact Rules**:

- description: 'Vercel CLI cookbook for this Next.js + Supabase + Vercel boilerplate. Covers deployment verification (poll by commit SHA + `vercel inspect --wait`), env var sync between `.env` and Vercel scopes (Preview / Production / Development), build and runtime log streaming, rollback, and `.vercel/` project linking detection. Trigger whenever the user runs `vercel`, asks to "check deploy status", "wait until ready", "is my deploy live", "sync env vars to Vercel", "push env to Vercel", "see build logs", "tail Vercel logs", "rollback last deploy", "promote to production", "link this repo to Vercel", or any vercel-CLI-shaped task. Composes with `/deploy-to-vercel` (community skill, owns the deploy method selection) and `/sprint-development` (Stages 9 & 12 own the deploy orchestration). Do NOT use for: choosing a deploy method or doing a first-time link (use `/deploy-to-vercel`), driving the full sprint deploy stage (use `/sprint-development`), reading Supabase as source-of-truth for env values (use Supabase MCP — Vercel only mirrors them), or Bitbucket / Netlify / Cloudflare deployment (out of scope).'

- `vercel` is Vercel's official command-line client. In this boilerplate it is the primary verification + env-management surface for our standard stack: **Next.js + Supabase + Vercel + Resend**, with branch-based auto-deploys (`develop` → Vercel Preview / staging, `main` → Vercel Production).
- This skill teaches the operations that live AROUND a deploy — confirming it actually shipped, pushing the right env vars before it ships, tailing logs when it breaks, rolling back when it breaks badly. The act of TRIGGERING a deploy (choosing between git push, `vercel deploy`, or first-time `vercel link`) is owned by the community skill `/deploy-to-vercel`. This skill points at it; it does not duplicate it.
- `vercel` is easy to misuse in three specific ways that have burned past sessions:
- 1. **`vercel ls | grep` is the wrong tool to check whether YOUR deploy is ready.** ANSI color codes break the regex, and the output mixes new and old deploys for the same branch. The canonical "is this exact commit deployed" question has a different answer: `vercel ls -m githubCommitSha=<sha> --format json` to find the URL, then `vercel inspect <url> --wait --timeout=10m` to block until terminal state.
- 2. **`vercel deploy` blocks by default; `vercel inspect` does NOT.** That asymmetry is backwards from intuition and trips agents constantly. Rule: **always pass `--no-wait` to `vercel deploy`** (return URL immediately), **always pass `--wait` to `vercel inspect`** (block until READY / ERROR / CANCELED). See `references/gotchas.md`.
